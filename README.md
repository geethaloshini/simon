# Simon
A classic Simon game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates a simple implementation of the popular memory game where players must remember and replicate increasingly complex sequences of colors.

**Features**
**Color Sequence Generation**: The game generates a random sequence of colors that players must follow.
**User Interaction**: Players interact by clicking on color buttons, attempting to replicate the sequence.
**Difficulty Progression**: As players succeed, the sequence length increases, adding to the challenge.

**Technologies Used**
**HTML**: Structure and content of the game.
**CSS**: Styling and layout for the game interface.
**JavaScript**: Game logic, sequence generation, and user interaction handling.
